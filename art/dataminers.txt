Why there is no one folder for all the dataminer intead? Cause yes. that's it.
Oh and also in source code there is a "assets/preload/" folder which gets renamed to "assets/" while compiling the game. So if you are not using source code, you can just ignore the preload folder.
Ok so here are the folders you can look up for easter eggs I left:
assets/preload/data/corn-maze/
assets/preload/data/vault/
assets/preload/images/ - You can find some cool memes here. Also please add (unrelated to the mod) information about Lexi from one screenshot as soon as possible to Funkipedia. It's from official server.
assets/preload/images/characters/jsons/ - I left a naughty meme(?)
assets/preload/images/icons/ - Huh? Why is it listed here?
assets/preload/videos/
assets/shared/music/ - You can find scrapped Kaskudek's theme during dialogue
assets/vsSomeTrioweek/images/scribblematicTrio/comics/ - Read those comics if you think your life is boring. Some of them are canon to this mod's lore
assets/vsSomeTrioweek/images/scribblematicTrio/discord_emojis/ - Use them on your servers
assets/vsSomeTrioweek/images/scribblematicTrio/lore as memes/ - Memes/Shitposts that show canon stuff to this mod's lore in a funny way
assets/vsSomeTrioweek/images/scribblematicTrio/memes/ - funi stuff hehe
assets/vsSomeTrioweek/sounds/ - Listen to the mod's death quotes
