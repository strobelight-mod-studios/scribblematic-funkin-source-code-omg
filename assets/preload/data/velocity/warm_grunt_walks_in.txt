:kaskudek:Woah, that was kinda fun. Maybe we'll try doin' this later.
:gf2:That's great to hear. I'm sure that my cute little boy could teach you more on how to do that, if you ask him
:bf2:BEEP!
:bf2:Boop beep?
:gf2:Huh? What's the matter?
:bf2:Bop.
:gf2:Oh, this guy. He looks similar to these ones we met in Nevada.
:kaskudek:Oh, this guy is my friend.
:gf2:Is he here to attack us or something?
:kaskudek:Nah, he's friendly to new people.
:kaskudek:Oh, Chill Grunt. These are Boyfriend and Girlfriend. They came here to sing with Teo, but for some reason, Teo is getting late.
:cg:Oh. Uhmmmm... Hi.
:bf2:Boopeb! Bop beep bop! Bap!
:cg:I'm sorry, I can't understand you. Can you use English or Arabic?
:kaskudek:He can indeed speak English, but he does not want to. Probably shy or something
:gf2:Kind of, but yeah. You can check his emotions and expression to try understanding him tho.
:kaskudek:As I see, he wants to rap, doesn't he?
:gf2:Yup.
:kaskudek:Okay Chill Grunt, try to kill some time with this midget while Teotm isn't here. 
:cg:Fine by me. This day was boring anyways.
:bf2:Bap bop!
:gf2:Okay, you two get ready!
